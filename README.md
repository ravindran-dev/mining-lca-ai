# 🌍 AI-Driven Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Tool for Mining & Metallurgy  

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Mining and metallurgy industries are resource-intensive and generate significant environmental impacts. Traditional **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** methods are manual, time-consuming, and complex.  

Our solution leverages **AI and data-driven models** to:  
- Automate LCA calculations  
- Predict environmental impact (carbon, water, energy)  
- Support circularity and sustainability in mining operations  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Build an **AI-powered LCA tool** for mining and metallurgy.  
- Assess **environmental, energy, and resource impacts** of mining activities.  
- Provide **actionable insights** for sustainability and circularity.  
- Enable decision-makers to optimize processes and reduce carbon footprint.
